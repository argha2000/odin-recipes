    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken breast</li>
      <li>Cream</li>
      <li>Yogurt</li>
      <li>Garam masala</li>
      <li>Cumin</li>
      <li>Turmeric</li>
      <li>Red chilly powder</li>
      <li>tomatoes</li>
      <li>Ginger</li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>First, mix your yogurt marinade together.</li>
      <li>
        Marinate chicken for 20 minutes, or overnight if time allows. (The
        longer it marinates, the more tender your chicken will be.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Sear chicken in a skillet or pan. Keep those charred bits on the pan to
        make your sauce. Browned bits = flavour. If you have too many burnt
        pieces stuck to the pan, you can discard some of them if you wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        The trick to making a great sauce is to let the tomatoes cook off for at
        least 10-15 minutes, until they are almost dry on your pan.
        Additionally, you can add in a couple tablespoons of water if it dries
        to early.
      </li>
      <li>
        After that, blend until smooth and add in your cream (heavy whipping
        cream or thickened cream). You can use evaporated milk or half and half
        for a lower calorie option.
      </li>
